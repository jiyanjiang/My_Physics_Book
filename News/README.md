- Lester Ingber: [Feynman Stories](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/stories/lester_ingber_story.html)

> When I was an Assistant Professor at SUNY, Stony Brook, I met Feynman again at a conference on partons in 1969, and I drove him back to the airport afterwards. He asked how I liked his lecture, e.g., relative to the others like C.N. Yang's. He was very appreciative of my remarks: I said that, unlike Yang who brought to bear a sophisticated arsenal of mathematics to develop some aspects of partons, his [Feynman's] lecture developed a coarse intuitive approach with minimal algebra -- but was an approach commensurate with the (lack of) knowledge of partons at that time, yet yielding more specificity of aspects of partons than the other lectures. I think that kind of approach was quintessential Feynman.

> Because it is water miscible it rinses away water from equipment too, thereby leaving equipment with less water on them and this means they will dry much faster than using water alone.
